# Cab-Booking-System
The Cab Booking System is a modular, Java-based console application designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This project provides a simple simulation of an online cab booking platform where users can register, book rides, assign drivers and vehicles, make payments, and manage data through controllers and views.
